# Text transcript reference:

Hello, my name is Kirill, I am 20 years old and I am a beginner frontend developer.

In the previous year, I graduated from the Nizhny Novgorod Radio Technical College with a degree in Computer Systems and Complexes, after which I decided to deepen my knowledge in the field of web application development. At the moment, I am studying on the Front-end course at RS School to improve my skills.
Since 2022, I have also been working as a programming teacher at an online school, where we study the basics of web development, Python, and for the youngest kids - Scratch.

My goal is to become an experienced Front-end developer and make a significant contribution
to creating convenient and beautiful websites and applications. I am inspired by the opportunity that development provides, giving endless chances to create innovative solutions for real problems.

Recently, I completed a project in JS called 'Pairs', in which I had to create a game where you need to select matching cards within a set time. To implement the project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and faced challenges such as modular programming, which was my first experience with this. Despite this, I successfully achieved the set goals, such as:
1. Implementation of a menu to select the number of cards (4, 16, or 36)
2. Start game button
3. Game process and victory upon finding all pairs
4. Game reset button
This project strengthened my passion for programming and inspired me to continue learning in this area.

In addition to programming, I have other interests and hobbies. One of my favorites is traveling. I enjoy visiting cities, exploring landmarks, attending various exhibitions and events. Recently, I visited Moscow, and it brought me a lot of impressions.

I also enjoy reading books, especially in the field of psychology. Reading such books helps me better understand myself, develop empathy towards others, and apply the knowledge gained in life. I find pleasure in analyzing and discussing mindsets, both my own and others', as well as finding practical applications of psychological concepts in everyday communication.

Also, I enjoy building models and painting by numbers. These activities not only bring me joy but also help me relax, take a break from everyday worries, and immerse myself in the world of creativity and imagination.

I love spending my free time visiting interesting places with my girlfriend, such as cafes and restaurants with a great atmosphere and delicious food, walks in the parks of my city, and attending interesting events and places.

I hope that my presentation was interesting and informative for you. I tried to convey all the key points and details about my life. Bye bye!
